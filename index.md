## Research Interests

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall admission. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**

- Speech Perception
- Neural Oscillation
- Neurolinguistics
- Prososdy & Emotion
- Simultaneous EEG-fNIRS

I currently utilize Frequency-Tagging Paradigm by simultaneous EEG-fNIRS Acquisition to investigate the neural tracking and 'entrainment echoes'(van Bree et al., 2021; Zoefel et al., 2024) to acoustic envelope and higher linguistics strcuture. This project addresses several key questions: 1) the causal relationship between neural oscillations and speech perception, 2) the distinct representations of predicting versus perceiving speech, 3) the dissociative neural circuits of endogenous and exogenous oscillations during speech processing. In the near future, I plan to employ tDCS and tACS to further explore the causal links between neural dynamics and speech processing, particularly at higher linguistic levels. <br/>  


**Abstract(Ongoing Paper)** 

  
Both the acoustic properties and the linguistic content of speech elicit neural dynamic changes, which have been shown to follow the temporal structure of language across different time scales. This study primarily investigates whether the brain can infer (abstract) the temporal structure patterns of speech based on the rhythmical context by the entrainment mechanism, which can also be used to predict and regulate the segmentation of speech flow. Specifically, we will examine whether the neural entrainment to rhythmic structure sustains after the speech stimulus disappear and biases the speech segmentation and combination. By this way, we can demonstrate that neural entrainment not only causally modulates speech segmentation at the acoustic level but also at the higher structural level.
